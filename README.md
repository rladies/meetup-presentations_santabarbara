# Welcome to R-Ladies Santa Barbara! 

R-Ladies Santa Barbara welcomes members of all R proficiency levels, whether you're a new or aspiring R user, or an experienced R programmer interested in mentoring, networking & expert upskilling. Our non-profit, civil society community is designed to develop our members' R skills & knowledge through social, collaborative learning & sharing. Supporting minority identity access to STEM skills & careers, the Free Software Movement, and contributing to the global R community!

A local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://rladies.org/), R-Ladies Santa Barbara exists to promote diversity in the R community, both locally and worldwide. We are pro-actively inclusive of queer, trans, and all minority identities, with additional sensitivity to intersectional identities. Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in and/or working with R. As a founding principle, there is no cost or charge to participate in any of our R-Ladies communities around the world.

We are part of Global R-Ladies group. You can access our presentations, R scripts and more below, and by exploring the [R-Ladies Global Github account](https://github.com/rladies). Follow us on Twitter [@RLadiesSB](https://twitter.com/rladiessb?lang=en) to stay up to date about R-Ladies news!

## Code of Conduct

R-Ladies Santa Barbara is dedicated to providing harassment-free event experiences for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.

We ask that all participants review and abide by the R-Ladies [Code of Conduct](https://guide.rladies.org/about/coc/).

### Community Policy

The leadership, mentoring & teaching roles within this Community are held exclusively by minority genders (majority gender speakers may be allowed/invited as one-off guests in exceptional circumstances at the leadership team's discretion). Due to unexpected demand, we have opened learning participation to all genders, dependent on initial and on-going vetting by the leadership team. However, the stated priority of the R-Ladies communities is the development & support specifically of those identifying as a minority gender, and we, therefore, reserve the right to guard this interest through whatever measures the leadership team deems appropriate. Anyone involved with R-Ladies Santa Barbara is expected to fully respect each other, the mandate of this community, and the goodwill on which R-Ladies is founded, or face expulsion/a penalty of any form, at the discretion of the leadership team.

Full community guidelines are found here: https://guide.rladies.org/

By taking part in an R-Ladies Santa Barbara event you grant the community organisers full rights to use the images resulting from the photography/video filming/media, and any reproductions or adaptations of the images for publicity, fundraising or other purposes to help achieve the communityâ€™s aims. This might include (but is not limited to), the right to use them in their printed and online publicity, social media, press releases and funding applications.
